The quiz comprises three rounds, designed to progressively challenge and identify the best young minds. The Preliminary Round will be conducted at individual schools between mid-June and early July, on dates mutually decided between the organizers and the institution. Successful teams from the Preliminary Round will qualify for the Zonal Final, which will be held at multiple regional centers during the month of August. The top-performing teams from each zone will move on to the Grand Finale, a large-scale event hosted at NIT Calicut in September.

Participation in the quiz is open to students of Classes 7 through 12. The competition is divided into two categories based on class levels: the Junior Category includes students from Classes 7 to 10, and the Senior Category is for those in Classes 11 and 12. Each participating team must consist of two students. A nominal registration fee of Rs.50 per team is applicable, which should be submitted at the time of registration.

The core focus of the quiz is to assess and enhance students' logical reasoning and mathematical problem-solving abilities. In order to ensure fairness and relevance, separate question papers are prepared for the Junior and Senior categories. This structure allows participants to face questions that are appropriate for their level of academic experience and aptitude.

Cash prizes will be awarded to the top three winning teams at the Grand Finale. Additionally, the best performers in the Zonal Final will also receive cash rewards, encouraging participation and rewarding excellence at every stage of the competition. The quiz aims not only to foster a spirit of healthy academic rivalry but also to recognize and celebrate young talent in problem-solving.

In past years, this quiz has been successfully conducted across South India and the Middle East, where it has received enthusiastic participation from numerous schools. The event has built a strong reputation for inspiring and engaging students, and for providing a platform to develop critical thinking and analytical skills.
